# Installation in dev mode is broken and works as expected in production. 
# Use this URL to install the app instead:
# https://ngrok-url.io/auth?shop=storename.myshopify.com

## Notes
# Ensure SHOPIFY_APP_URL starts with `https://`, and it shouldn't end in a `/`
# When deploying to a service like Heroku, ensure NPM_CONFIG_FORCE is set to `true` so it runs `npm i --force` instead of just `npm i`.
